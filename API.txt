<h4>hook_content_lock_skip_locking($node, $form_id, $form, $form_state)</h4>
Implement this hook if you want to force the skipping of a lock out of any reasons or logic you want.
Be sure to check $node for null, as it might no always be an object. 
If you return true, the lock wont be applied (so skipped).

<h4>hook_content_lock_form_id_blacklist_alter($blacklist, $node = null)</h4>
Implement this hook to be able to alter the blacklist of form_ids, where locking will be skipped.
As parameter you get the current node, if the object is preset. You can implement your own logic here
If you want to blacklist a node type, add $blacklist['your_form_id'] = TRUE;

<h4>hook_content_lock_node_type_blacklist_alter($blacklist,$node)</h4>
Implement this hook to be able to alter the blacklist of node_types, where locking will be skipped.
This hook only gets called if a node object is set at all (as otherwise types wont be able to be checked).
If you want to blacklist a node type, add $blacklist['your_type_machine_name'] = TRUE;

<h4>hook_content_lock_locked($nid,$uid)</h4>
This hook gets called, when a lock gets set. Implement this if you want to trigger any actions when a lock gets applied.
